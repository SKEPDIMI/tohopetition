      "Our school, like others, has tried to make an alternative event. Tohoâ€™s idea of a ceremony like parade of cars is not well thought out and quite frankly is not what we would like as our graduation. Their idea is not safe."

      I'm going to keep this simple. This website will generate for you a template with your personal information, in order for students, and parents of students, <strong>to contact Tohopekaliga staff, and influence the upcoming, class of 2020, graduation ceremony.</strong>

            To whom it may concern,

            My name is ${name}, I'm ${desc}. I am writing this on behalf of the Class of 2020. It is obvious that due to current events, a decision was made so that the Tohopekaliga Class of 2020 would not be receiving a traditional graduation ceremony and instead, a drive-by one. To hear this was not only heartbreaking, but utterly devastating. Over the past couple of months, things have been taken away from them that were out of anybodyâ€™s control: GradBash, prom, Decision Day, etc, and we fully understand why this happened. There are some things, however, that can be controlled, with graduation being one of them. The Class of 2020 deserves nothing less than to walk across the stage and have their names spoken out so that each student is recognized for their individual work, efforts and development throughout the years. Other schools in the district, including ones that we attended before coming to Tohopekaliga,are holding staggered graduations in which their students are still able to walk. The Tohopekaliga Class of 2020 simply asks that you listen to us and that we get to do the same.

            Thank you,
            ${name}
